## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

Guiding Question:

What is the project?
The project is a website for TechVerse Innovations, a company specializing in cutting-edge technological solutions, such as AI, Blockchain, and IoT. The website serves as a digital platform to showcase the company's services, provide valuable information, and facilitate customer interaction.

What’s the purpose?
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the application of HTML and CSS in creating visually appealing and functional web pages. It aims to highlight different design features, present information clearly, and provide an interactive user experience. Additionally, it serves as a learning tool to understand the principles of web design and front-end development, helping to improve practical skills in building responsive, modern websites.

What are key components?
Header: Contains the website title, navigation menu, and logo, offering easy access to all sections.

Main Content Area: Includes the hero section with a welcome message and company tagline, along with information about services and key offerings.

Navigation Menu: A responsive menu with links to different pages like Home, Services, About Us, Contact Us, and Sign Up.

Feature Displays: Various sections that present key services, such as AI Solutions, Blockchain Consulting, IoT Services, and more, with descriptions and call-to-action buttons.

Footer: Contains additional information, such as copyright details, contact information, and social media links.

CSS Styling: Controls the visual presentation, including layout, typography, color scheme, and responsiveness.

Interactive Elements: Includes buttons for opening forms, dynamic content (e.g., popups), and smooth page transitions for a better user experience.

What technology used and how it is used?

HTML: Used to structure the content of the web pages. It defines elements like headers, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and buttons to organize and present information effectively.

CSS: Applied to style the HTML content. It controls the visual presentation—background colors, fonts, text alignment, element positioning, borders, etc. For example, it is used to define the hero section's background, the color of buttons, and the layout of service sections.

Bootstrap: Integrated to provide a responsive grid system and pre-styled components. This makes it easier to create a consistent layout that adapts to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).

JavaScript (if applicable): JavaScript is used for interactivity on the site. For instance, it can handle events like opening or closing service form popups when buttons are clicked. It also can be used to add dynamic behavior such as form validation or smooth scrolling animations.

External Resources: Links to external resources like Google Fonts for typography (Lexend, Press Start 2P) and the Bootstrap CDN to simplify layout management and responsiveness.

Key Components

Multi-Page Website: The website consists of multiple pages, including a home page, service descriptions, an about us section, a contact page, and a sign-up page.

Parallax Transition: Using smooth scrolling and background transitions to create a more dynamic and engaging visual experience as users interact with the page.

Interactive Forms: Including forms for contacting the company, signing up, and service requests, designed to enhance user engagement and facilitate customer interactions.

Responsive Design: Ensures the website adapts to various screen sizes (from mobile to desktop) using media queries, grid layouts, and flexible components provided by Bootstrap.

Stylish UI Elements: Buttons, navigation links, and sections designed with visual consistency and ease of use in mind, contributing to an intuitive user interface.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
